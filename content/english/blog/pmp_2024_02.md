PMBOK & Agile practice guide & Process Group

According to PMI, the PMP (Project Management Professional) certificate exam includes content that spans the value delivery spectrum, including predictive, adaptive, and hybrid approaches. It is based on Exam Content Outline (ECO), revised every 4 or 5 years by PMI.

Most recently, the ECO has been updated since January 2021. Accordingly, the exam has been tested on three different domains:

* **People (42%)**

* **Process (50%)**

* **Business Environment (8%)**

Together with ECO, the PMP exam was updated in 2021 to reflect the fuller complement of skills and approaches found in our dynamic and global profession. This also explains why PMI has recently removed PMBOK 6th Edition from their Exam Reference List, replacing it with 7th Edition.* *PMI recommends a list of the ten most used books as sources cited as part of exam question development (which, again, does not currently include PMBOK 6th Edition).

Basically, 6 of them are not necessary for your exam preparation because their essential content is already in the remaining four books that you must have, including:

* **ECO**

* **PMBOK Guide 7th Edition**

* **The Agile Practice Guide**

* **Process Groups: A Practice Guide**

I consolidated all the important knowledges and mindset in one cheat sheet, it is an essential notes for an individual to review all necessary informatiom ahead a day of taking the exam, as well as an hour recap! Sample pages as following, support me on ko-fi, link at the bottom of the article.
